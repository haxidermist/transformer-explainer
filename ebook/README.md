## About This Book

This book emerged from a deep dive into the Transformer Explainer codebase - an interactive visualization of how GPT-2 works. What started as debugging import path issues evolved into a comprehensive exploration of modern language models, their architectures, and the philosophical questions around AI transparency.

Like "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," this book interweaves technical understanding with deeper questions about how we make complex systems comprehensible. Instead of motorcycle maintenance, we're maintaining our understanding of how machines learn language.

## Structure

This book is organized into chapters that can be read sequentially or as standalone references. Each chapter builds on conversations, code explorations, and experiments with the Transformer Explainer.

## Reading Guide

- **For Beginners:** Start with Chapter 1-3 to understand what transformers are and how they work
- **For Developers:** Jump to Chapter 4-6 for implementation details and architecture decisions
- **For ML Engineers:** Chapters 7-9 cover advanced topics like MoE and training dynamics
- **For Philosophers:** The interludes explore the nature of AI understanding and transparency

## How to Use This Book

This is a living document that grows over time. Each chapter includes:
- 📖 **Concepts:** Core ideas and theory
- 💻 **Code Examples:** Real code from the Transformer Explainer
- 🔬 **Experiments:** Things to try in the visualization
- 🤔 **Reflections:** Deeper questions and insights
- 📚 **References:** Further reading

## Version History

- **v0.1.0** (January 2025) - Initial release covering GPT-2 architecture, MoE, and core concepts
